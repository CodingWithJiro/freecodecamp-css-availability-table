## A Simple Availability Table Web Page

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project is a responsive availability table that visually represents time slot data using colored cells. The gradient legend provides a key to quickly interpret the availability levels from 0 (least available) to 5 (most available). It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the **[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)** CSS course.

---

## Overview

This project features a structured HTML table layout enhanced with visual indicators of availability throughout the week. Each time slot is color-coded based on availability values, and rows alternate between solid and dashed borders for clarity.

A fully custom CSS legend using Flexbox and a gradient bar enhances the user experience and accessibility by offering an intuitive interpretation of the data. The project emphasizes semantic HTML, table styling, and the use of CSS variables for scalable design.
